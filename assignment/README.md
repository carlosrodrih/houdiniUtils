# Week 7 Assignment
For this assigment I used [Titanic Data]( https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data ) from Kaggle. 

I used the gender_submission.csv, which has a "Survived" column wich assume only female passengers survive. I merged this column with the test.csv dataset just for testing purposes, and I created all the plots with that merged dataset. That's why the plots with gender data appear unusual.
