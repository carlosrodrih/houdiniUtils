- gltf_to_usd.py: this contains the code used inside the shelf tool to create the template for GLTF to USD conversion.
- run_on_template: also to use it as a tool, it executes using the template on all files within a specified folder.
- run_on_template_2: script designed to be run from the Houdini Terminal using a bash script.
- batch_process: executable intended to be run from the Houdini Terminal. Requires specifying the folder containing GLTF files and the Houdini template hip file.

To use these scripts from the terminal, ensure that GLTF files are organized within folders accordingly.
